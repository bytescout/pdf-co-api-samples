16. Configure Dropbox upload fields. In field "Folder", select Dropbox folder where new files should be created.
Field "File" represents input file URL, here specify generated barcode file URL from pdf.co.
Specify whether new file should replace existing file with same name or not in "Overwrite" field.
Field "Specify File Name" should be filled with name of target file. In this case we can select "InvoiceId" from spreadsheet.
And finally provide target file extension in "Specify File Extension" field.
With this configuration, it'll create files in Dropbox folder with "InvoiceNo.png" format.
